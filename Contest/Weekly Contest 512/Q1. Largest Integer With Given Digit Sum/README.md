# [Q1. Largest Integer With Given Digit Sum](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-512/problems/largest-integer-with-given-digit-sum/)

`Easy` `3 pt.`

You are given two non-negative integers n and s.

Return the largest integer that has at most n digits and whose sum of digits is s. If no such integer exists, return -1.

Example 1:

> Input: n = 2, s = 9  
> Output: 90  
> Explanation:  
> The largest integer with at most 2 digits that has a sum of digits of 9 is 90.  

Example 2:

> Input: n = 2, s = 19  
> Output: -1  
> Explanation:  
> There is no integer with at most 2 digits that has a sum of digits of 19, so the answer is -1.

Example 3:

> Input: n = 5, s = 0  
> Output: 0  
> Explanation:  
> The only non-negative integer whose digits sum to 0 is 0.

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 5
- 0 <= s <= 100
